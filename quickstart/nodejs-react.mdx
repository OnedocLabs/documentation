## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

- [Sign-up/in to Onedoc](https://app.onedoclabs.com/)
- [Generate your API Key](https://app.onedoclabs.com/)

## 1. Installation

<Tip>
  Want to get started without a project? We have setup a [simple
  CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/onedoc-template-invoice-forked-jdyw6j?embed=1&file=%2Findex.tsx)
  for you to try out.
</Tip>

Get the Onedoc Node.js SDK

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install -s @onedoc/client
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @onedoc/client
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @onedoc/client
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create a document template

Start by creating your document template on `components/pdf-template.js`.<br/>Your file must export a React component.

```javascript components/pdf-template.jsx
import * as React from "react";

export const PDFTemplate = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Hello {name} !</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

and optionally, a stylesheet:

```css stylesheet.css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

## 3. Generate your PDF

Get your API key at https://app.onedoclabs.com/.

Import the React document template and generate a PDF using your `ONEDOC_API_KEY` and your main React component.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript generate.jsx
import React from "react";
import { PDFTemplate } from "./components/pdf-template";
import { Onedoc } from "@onedoc/client";
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import { join } from "path";

(async () => {
  const onedoc = new Onedoc(ONEDOC_API_KEY);

  let doc = {
    html: renderToString(<PDFTemplate name="Bruce Wayne" />),
    title: "Hello",
    test: true,
    save: true,
    expiresIn: 30,
    assets: [
      {
        path: "./stylesheet.css",
        content: readFileSync(join(process.cwd(), "stylesheet.css")).toString(),
      },
    ],
  };

  const { file, link, error, info } = await onedoc.render(doc);

  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(link);
})();
```

</CodeGroup>

Stylesheets and other referenced assets should be passed in the `asset` parameter. If you are using a framework such as Tailwind, you must submit a <b>compiled stylesheet</b> that can be applied to a HTML file that contains the compiled React component. <br/>
You must upload the content of your asset in string or Buffer format in the `content` field.
