## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

- [Sign-up/in to Onedoc](https://app.onedoclabs.com/login)
- [Generate your API Key](https://app.onedoclabs.com/)

## 1. Installation
If you did not have set up a NodeJS project, you can use the following command to do so: 

```sh npm
npm init -y
```

Get the Onedoc Node.js SDK

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install -s @onedoc/client
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @onedoc/client
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @onedoc/client
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Generate your PDF

Creat a new file `generate.js`, import the React document template and generate a PDF using your `ONEDOC_API_KEY`.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript generate.js
import { Onedoc } from "@onedoc/client";
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "fs";

(async () => {
  const onedoc = new Onedoc(ONEDOC_API_KEY);

  let doc = {
    html: "<h1>Hello World</h1>",
    title: "Hello world",
    test: true,
    save: true,
    expiresIn: 30,
    assets: [],
  };

  const { file, link, error, info } = await onedoc.render(doc);

  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(link);
})();
```

</CodeGroup>

You are almost done ! Run the script using the following command : 

```sh terminal
node ./generate.js
```
