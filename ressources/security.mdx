## Data Protection

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Data at rest"
    icon="database"
  >
    All datastores are encrypted at rest. Sensitive collections and tables also use row-level encryption.  
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Data in transit"
    icon="network-wired"
  >
    Resend uses TLS 1.3 or higher everywhere data is transmitted over potentially insecure networks.  
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Data backup"
    icon="server"
  >
    Resend backs-up all production data using a point-in-time approach. Backups are persisted for 30 days, and are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters.  
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
  ## In-house security

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Endpoint protection"
    icon="computer"
  >
    All company devices are equipped with anti-malware protection. Endpoint security alerts are monitored with 24/7/365 coverage. We use MDM software to enforce secure configuration of endpoints, such as disk encryption, screen lock configuration, and software updates.  
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Education"
    icon="user-graduate"
  >
    Onedoc provides comprehensive security training to all employees upon onboarding and annually. Onedoc conducts threat briefings with employees to inform them of important security and safety-related updates that require special attention or action.  
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="ID & Access"
    icon="passport"
  >
    Onedoc employees are granted access to applications based on their role, and automatically deprovisioned upon termination of their employment. Further access must be approved according to the policies set for each application. Multi-factor authentication is required for all employees to access company applications.
  </Card>
