## OneDoc: The Document API for developers


OneDoc revolutionizes document creation by offering an API that empowers developers to effortlessly generate PDFs. Acknowledging the vast number of documents businesses produce annually, we move beyond outdated, manual methods. Our solution allows for easy template creation using React components or preferred programming languages, transforming these into professional PDFs. OneDoc not only simplifies document creation but enhances control with features like automation, e-signatures, and A/B testing, all from a single endpoint. Our platform saves time and elevates document quality, offering valuable insights through analytics and tracking, making OneDoc a comprehensive, innovative solution for document management.

## Story

Our journey with OneDoc began in our previous venture, where we faced challenges in document creation for multinational companies. Initially using Microsoft Office, we quickly encountered the limitations of its templates. Seeking flexibility, we turned to LaTeX, which, despite its comprehensive features, demanded a steep learning curve. Our exploration continued with Python libraries for document creation, but these too fell short in aesthetics and efficiency. This led us to develop an in-house solution using React components to generate PDFs. Realizing the universal need for efficient document creation, we joined Y Combinator to develop OneDoc - a comprehensive API enabling developers worldwide to easily create custom PDF templates with React. Our mission was clear: to simplify document generation for businesses of all sizes and sectors.
