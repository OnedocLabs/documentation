This component is designed to create an automatically numbered footnote within your document. It supports rich text for detailed annotations or references.

## Usage

The `Footnote` component is used to embed footnote references directly within your content. It can contain any React node, allowing for flexible usage with both plain text and more complex elements.

### Example

```jsx
<Footnote>
  This is an example footnote with <strong>rich text</strong> capabilities.
</Footnote>
```

### Props

- **children**: `React.ReactNode` - The content of the footnote. Supports rich text formatting, enabling the inclusion of elements like `<strong>`, `<em>`, or any other valid HTML/React components.

### Styling

The component comes with predefined styling for a footnote appearance:

- **Class Name**: `--docify-footnote` - Applies basic styling for footnotes.
- **Text Alignment**: `text-left` - Ensures that the footnote text is aligned to the left.
- **Font Size**: `text-xs` - Sets the font size to extra small for a subtle appearance.
- **Font Weight**: `font-normal` - Uses the normal font weight for footnote text.

You can further customize the appearance using additional CSS rules targeting the `--docify-footnote` class in your custom stylesheet.
