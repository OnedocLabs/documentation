These components are designed to dynamically create running headers in your documents, tailored to different heading levels (H1 through H6). They enable the inclusion of content before and after the main text of the header, allowing for flexible header designs.

## Usage

Each `RunningHx` component corresponds to a heading level from `H1` to `H6`. You can specify content to appear before and after the main header text via props.

### Example

```jsx
import { RunningH1, RunningH2 } from "@onedoc/react-print";

const YourComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <RunningH1 before="Chapter 1: " after=" - Introduction" />
    <RunningH2 before="Section 1.1: " after=" - Overview" />
  </div>
);
```

This will render `H1` and `H2` headers with specified prefixes and suffixes.

### Props

Each `RunningHx` component accepts the following props:

- **before**: `string` (optional) - Text or content to display before the main header text.
- **after**: `string` (optional) - Text or content to display after the main header text.

### Styling

Each running header component comes with predefined styling to ensure consistency across different heading levels. They are styled with the following class names:

- General class: `--docify-heading-contents`
- Level-specific class: `--docify-hx-contents` (where `x` is the heading level, from 1 to 6)

You can customize their appearance further by adding styles in `headings.css`, targeting the specific classes.

### Customization

To customize the appearance of running headers or add additional functionality, you can modify the `RunningHeader` factory function or create similar components based on the same pattern.
