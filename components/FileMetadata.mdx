The Page Numbering components consist of `PageNumber` and `TotalPages`, designed to display the current page number and total number of pages within a document. These components are particularly useful in documentation or publishing contexts where dynamic page numbering is required.

## Usage

### PageNumber

The `PageNumber` component is used to display the current page number. It automatically updates based on the current page context.

```jsx
import { PageNumber } from "@onedoc/react-print";

const YourComponent = () => (
  <div>
    Page <PageNumber /> of <TotalPages />
  </div>
);
```

### TotalPages

The `TotalPages` component displays the total number of pages in the document. Like `PageNumber`, it automatically adjusts based on the total page count.

```jsx
import { TotalPages } from "@onedoc/react-print";
```

Incorporate `TotalPages` alongside `PageNumber` to provide a complete page count reference.

## Styling

Both components utilize CSS for styling:

- `PageNumber`: Styled with the class `--docify-page-number-current`, intended to highlight the current page number.
- `TotalPages`: Uses the class `--docify-page-number-total` for styling, focusing on the total page count display.

You can customize the appearance of these components via the `variables.css` file by targeting their respective classes.

### Example

```css
.--docify-page-number-current {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.--docify-page-number-total {
  color: #666;
}
```

These examples set the current page number to be bold and the total page count to a gray color. Adjust the CSS as needed to fit the design of your documentation.

## Integration

To integrate these components into your application or document layout, simply import and place them where the page count should be displayed. They are designed to be inserted directly into the text or existing components, providing a seamless experience for indicating page numbers.
