```

## Reference

### `Onedoc`

Constructor for the Onedoc client. Takes an API key as argument.

### `Onedoc.render`

The render function takes a document object as an argument and returns an object that contains the file or download link to the rendered document.

#### Parameters

<ResponseField name="document" type="object" required>
The `document` object has the following properties:
</ResponseField>
| name   | type                             | optional | default | description |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| html   | `string`                         | `false`  | `n/a`   | The html for your document ( for react, use renderToString)            |
| title  | `string`                         | `true`   | `n/a`   | The PDF's title            |
| test   | `string`                         | `true`   | `true`  | Determines whether a document is rendered with a watermark or not. Dev document renderings are free and can be made infinitely many times            |
| save   | `string`                         | `true`   | `false` | Determines whether a document should be saved temporarily. It is saved for as many days as provided in the `expiresIn` parameter. It can be downloaded anytime via a download link            |
| expiresIn  | `integer`                    | `true`   | `1`     | Determines for how long a document should be downloadable. Maximum duration is **90** days. This field is only effective if `save`is true         |
| assets | `PathString[] \| PathBuffer[]`   | `true`   | `n/a`   | A list of objects \{`path`, `content`\}, where `path`is a relative path from which the html should import the asset. `content` is the Buffer or string content of the asset|

Stylesheets should be loaded as assets. In the event where frameworks such as TailwindCss are used, remember to upload the compiled stylesheets.

#### Returns (promise)
